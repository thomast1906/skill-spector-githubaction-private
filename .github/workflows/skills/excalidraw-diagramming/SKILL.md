# Excalidraw MCP Diagramming

Create diagrams on a live Excalidraw canvas that renders in the browser and
updates in real time. You are not generating a static file — you are painting
onto a shared whiteboard through MCP tools. The canvas persists between calls,
so what you put on it in one call is visible in the next screenshot.

## When to Use

- The user asks to "create an excalidraw", "draw me a diagram", "make a flowchart", "visualise the system", or "diagram this architecture".
- The user wants an Excalidraw canvas output (not Draw.io / diagrams.net — use `drawio-mcp-diagramming` for that).
- The user wants to visualise an architecture, workflow, data flow, system design, mind map, or sequence diagram.
- The user asks to export a diagram to PNG, SVG, `.excalidraw` file, or a shareable URL.
- The user asks to update, change, or fix an existing Excalidraw diagram.

## Required MCP Server

The `excalidraw` MCP server must be present in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "excalidraw": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.excalidraw.com"
    }
  }
}
```

If the MCP tools are not available, tell the user to add the server and reload
VS Code, then stop.

## Available Tools

**Essential — use on every diagram:**

| Tool | Purpose | When |
|---|---|---|
| `read_diagram_guide` | Returns server-side colour palette and sizing rules | First call — before any elements |
| `batch_create_elements` | Creates multiple shapes and arrows atomically | Main workhorse |
| `get_canvas_screenshot` | Returns a photo of the current canvas | After every change — verify before continuing |
| `clear_canvas` | Wipes all content | Start of every new diagram |
| `set_viewport` | Scrolls and zooms to fit content | After creating elements |

**Secondary — use when needed:**

| Tool | When |
|---|---|
| `create_from_mermaid` | Quick drafts — 3–8 node sequential flows |
| `update_element` | Small corrections (position, colour, text) |
| `export_to_image` | User requests PNG or SVG file |
| `export_scene` | User requests editable `.excalidraw` file |
| `export_to_excalidraw_url` | User wants a shareable link |
| `describe_scene` | Audit what is currently on the canvas |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Choose the Creation Path

**Mermaid path** — use for simple sequential flows (3–8 nodes, no zones):

```
create_from_mermaid(
  mermaidDiagram="graph TD; A[Frontend] -->|REST| B[API]; B -->|SQL| C[DB]"
)
```

Then jump to Step 6 (screenshot). Skip Steps 2–5.

**Batch path** — use for everything else: layered architectures, data flows,
hub-and-spoke, any diagram needing zones or colour-coded roles. Continue below.

### Step 2 — Read the Design Guide

```
read_diagram_guide()
```

Retrieve the server's current colour palette and sizing rules. This call is
mandatory — the values may differ from the defaults in this skill. The server
guide takes precedence.

### Step 3 — Clear and Confirm Empty

```
clear_canvas()
get_canvas_screenshot()   // must verify the canvas is truly empty
```

Previous diagrams leave ghost data even after `clear_canvas`. If any element
is visible in the screenshot, call `clear_canvas()` again before proceeding.
Do not skip this confirmation — ghost elements silently break arrow bindings
on new diagrams.

### Step 4 — Plan the Layout

Before writing any JSON, decide:

- **Which pattern?** — See [references/canvas-patterns.md](references/canvas-patterns.md)
  for coordinate templates. Load it now if you are unsure which pattern fits.
- **Column spacing** — Labeled arrows need ≥150px clear gap between boxes.
  Budget 440px column pitch (230px box + 210px gap) for labeled arrows.
- **Row pitch** — Allow ~350px per row (160px box height + 190px gap for
  arrows, labels, and breathing room).
- **Zone positions** — Calculate zone backgrounds before placing shapes.
  Zone background: `y = row_y - 50`, `height = box_height + 100`.

Sketch coordinates to paper or comments before writing the batch payload.

### Step 5 — Create in One Batch

Call `batch_create_elements` with **all elements in one payload**. Arrow
binding resolves at batch time — if the target shape and arrow are not in the
same call, the arrow will not connect.

**Element order within the `elements` array matters for render layering:**

1. Zone backgrounds (large dashed rectangles, low opacity 25–40)
2. Shapes (rectangles, ellipses, diamonds) — assign unique `id` to each
3. Arrows — reference shapes by `startElementId` / `endElementId`
4. Standalone text (titles, zone labels, side annotations)

### Step 6 — Screenshot and Verify

```
get_canvas_screenshot()
```

Inspect the image:
- Are all labels readable and unclipped by their containers?
- Do arrows land on the correct shapes?
- Are zone backgrounds behind their contents, not on top?
- Is there ≥150px of clear space around labeled arrows?
- Are connections logically correct?

### Step 7 — Iterate and Refine

Load [references/iterative-refinement.md](references/iterative-refinement.md) if
the user asks to change, fix, or update an existing diagram. Quick reference:

**Audit first:**
```
describe_scene()   // returns all element ids, types, labels, positions
```
Use this before any edit — you need the exact element `id` to target.

**Small corrections** (label text, colour, position):
```
update_element({ id: "box-1", text: "New Label" })
update_element({ id: "box-1", backgroundColor: "#b2f2bb" })
```
Then `get_canvas_screenshot()` to verify.

**Shape replacement** (size, shape type, structural change):
```
batch_create_elements([{ "type": "delete", "ids": "old-id" }, ...newShapes, ...newArrows])
```
Arrows bound to the deleted shape must also be deleted and recreated in the
same batch — binding cannot be re-attached after the fact.

**Decision rule:**

| Change | Method |
|---|---|
| Text / colour / opacity / position | `update_element` |
| Shape size, shape type | delete + redraw in one batch |
| Moving an arrow endpoint | delete + redraw arrow in one batch with target shape |
| Restructuring a zone (adding/removing shapes) | delete zone bg + all children + redraw all in one batch |

### Step 8 — Zoom to Fit

```
set_viewport({ scrollToContent: true })
```

### Step 9 — Export (if requested)

```
// PNG or SVG
export_to_image({ format: "png", filePath: "/path/to/output.png" })

// Editable JSON file
export_scene({ filePath: "/path/to/output.excalidraw" })

// Shareable link — no file needed
export_to_excalidraw_url()
```

## Typography Rules

Minimum font sizes — never go smaller. Labels that look correct in JSON are
frequently unreadable in screenshots at display scale.

| Context | Minimum `fontSize` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Shape labels / body text | `16` | Default for all labeled boxes |
| Diagram title | `24` | Standalone text above the diagram |
| Zone / section heading | `16` | Inside or above zone background |
| Secondary annotations | `14` | Data form notes, layer labels only — use sparingly |
| **Absolute minimum** | `14` | Never use below 14 under any circumstance |

**Camera scale warning:** At `XXL` (1600×1200) the canvas renders at roughly
40% of original size in the chat panel. A `fontSize: 14` label renders at
~5px — invisible. Use `fontSize: 20+` for any label that must be readable
without the user zooming in. When in doubt, go larger.

## Shape Syntax

```json
{
  "type": "rectangle",
  "id": "api-server",
  "x": 440, "y": 200,
  "width": 230, "height": 160,
  "backgroundColor": "#d0bfff",
  "strokeColor": "#7048e8",
  "roughness": 0,
  "text": "API Server\nExpress.js"
}
```

- `roughness: 0` — crisp professional edges. `roughness: 1` — hand-drawn feel.
- `\n` in `text` creates multi-line labels.
- Types: `rectangle`, `ellipse`, `diamond`, `text` (standalone).
- Zone backgrounds: same as rectangle but add `strokeStyle: "dashed"` and
  `opacity: 30`.

## Arrow Syntax

```json
{
  "type": "arrow",
  "x": 0, "y": 0,
  "startElementId": "api-server",
  "endElementId": "database",
  "strokeColor": "#2f9e44",
  "text": "SQL"
}
```

- `x, y` are approximate — binding to `startElementId`/`endElementId`
  overrides position. The server auto-routes to the nearest edges.
- `startArrowhead` / `endArrowhead`: `"arrow"`, `"dot"`, `"bar"`, or `null`.
- `strokeStyle: "dashed"` — async or optional flows.
- `strokeStyle: "dotted"` — weak dependency.

## Colour Quick Reference

Read [references/color-palette.md](references/color-palette.md) for the full
semantic colour table — load it when choosing colours for a new diagram type.

| Role | Fill | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend / UI | `#a5d8ff` | `#1971c2` |
| Backend / API | `#d0bfff` | `#7048e8` |
| Database | `#b2f2bb` | `#2f9e44` |
| Queue / Events | `#fff3bf` | `#fab005` |
| External / Third-party | `#ffc9c9` | `#e03131` |
| Zone background | `#e9ecef` + `opacity:30` | `#868e96` dashed |

**Rule:** Same architectural role → same colour pair. Limit diagrams to 3–4
fills. More colours add noise, not clarity.

## Validation Checklist

Run through this before calling `set_viewport`. Fix any failures before
finishing — they compound and are harder to fix after zooming out.

**Arrow bindings**
- [ ] Every arrow has both `startElementId` and `endElementId` referencing
  elements that exist in the same batch
- [ ] No arrow was created in a call before its target shapes
- [ ] Deleted shapes had their bound arrows deleted and redrawn in the same batch

**Typography**
- [ ] All shape labels use `fontSize ≥ 16`
- [ ] Diagram title uses `fontSize ≥ 24`
- [ ] No font smaller than `14` anywhere
- [ ] Multi-line labels (`\n`) have enough box height (≥ 60px per line)

**Colour discipline**
- [ ] No more than 4 distinct fill colours in the diagram
- [ ] Same architectural role uses the same fill/stroke pair throughout
- [ ] Zone backgrounds have `opacity: 25–40` and `strokeStyle: "dashed"`

**Layout and spacing**
- [ ] Column gap between adjacent labeled boxes is ≥ 150px
- [ ] Zone backgrounds were placed in the batch **before** the shapes they contain
- [ ] Zone backgrounds do not hug inner boxes — ≥ 50px padding on all sides
- [ ] Title is horizontally centred over the diagram content

**Viewport**
- [ ] `set_viewport({ scrollToContent: true })` called as the final step
- [ ] Camera size is one of the approved 4:3 ratios (400×300, 600×450,
  800×600, 1200×900, 1600×1200)

## Anti-Patterns (Quick Reference)

| Anti-pattern | Why it causes problems |
|---|---|
| Skip screenshot after `clear_canvas` | Ghost elements silently corrupt new arrow bindings |
| Place arrows before their target shapes in a batch | Arrow IDs reference non-existent shapes — no binding |
| Column gap under 100px | Arrow labels bleed into adjacent shapes |
| Arrows without `startElementId`/`endElementId` | Arrow floats, doesn't update when shapes move |
| Skip `set_viewport` after creation | Diagram is off-screen and user sees a blank canvas |
| Zone backgrounds in a separate later batch | Zones render on top of shapes already on the canvas |
| More than 4 fill colours | Diagram becomes unreadable without a legend |
| `fontSize` below 16 on shape labels | Unreadable at XL/XXL camera scale |
| Editing a bound arrow with `update_element` | Binding is preserved but endpoints may drift — delete and redraw |

## Examples

**"Draw me a 3-tier web architecture"**

1. `read_diagram_guide()` — get colours
2. `clear_canvas()` → `get_canvas_screenshot()` — confirm empty
3. Plan: 3 zones (Frontend y=0, Backend y=360, Data y=720), 2 columns
4. `batch_create_elements([zones..., shapes..., arrows..., titles...])`
5. `get_canvas_screenshot()` — verify
6. `set_viewport({ scrollToContent: true })`

**"Quick flowchart of user login"**

1. `create_from_mermaid("graph TD; A[Enter email] --> B[Verify] --> C[Dashboard]")`
2. `get_canvas_screenshot()` — verify
